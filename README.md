# volition-hexwave
A Short Interactive Film, using Hexwave

To make this work, you need to:
- Download all of Volitons clips from [https://jaskowicz.xyz/Videos.zip](here).
- Extract the Videos folder to this directory.
- Open `Volition.hexw` and edit the video paths to this path (If you're on windows, make sure you do `\\` instead of `\`, for example: `C:\\volition-hexwave\\Videos\\SCENE1.mp4`).
- Enjoy!
